#Haskell CS 353 Implementations

These are the labs for CS 353 from a certain unnamed college with a certain
unnamed professor, implemented in Haskell.  Mostly I did this for fun, and to
force myself to learn more about functional programming.

If you found this as a student in CS 353 and are attempting to cheat, then
shame on you. But also, this is all in Haskell so it probably won't help you
very much, if at all (Which is why I haven't really tried that hard to stop
this from showing up in searches).
